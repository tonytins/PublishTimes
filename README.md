# Publish Times

This is a very simple console application that generates a list of times to publish news articles within a randomized 2-3 hour delay while avoiding time conflicts within a 30-minute window.

## Background

A while back, I [found a tool](https://schedule.lemmings.world) to schedule articles on Lemmy. I've been posting within a few hours apart at random minutes and I wanted to something decide that for me. I had AI write the base algorithm, everything else is my own touches.
